>>> basic work - make macroses not only for global use, but conference separated use. this work looks like done. now macroses may global and local (working only in conference, where it created). also I realized an opportunity to disable any commands in conference (ie not globally). this is "commoff" and "common" commands. bugfixes in this commit too
