what is this? this is Talisman ver.1 preXP1 source code.
what is XP1? it's eXperience Pack 1 for version 1 (tags\1).
why do we need it? for more bugs feedback. at first, i wished to publish XP1 when it will be completely done. but i'm changed my mind. well... some people WANTED to so it was ;) so, when it will be done - it will be moved to tags\1

how to install:
1)	edit config.txt
2)	run pybot.py
3)	from botadmin jid type to bot jid "חאיעט some_chat@at.some.server" OR
		create&edit dynamic\chatrooms.list. template is {u'some_chat@at.some.server': {'nick': u'bot_nick', 'passw': 'password'},u'another_some_chat@at.some.server': {'nick': u'another_bot_nick', 'passw': 'another_password'}} it's simple, eh?
4)	talisman@conference.jabber.ru is bot dev conf. so, bugs may be there

ps Talisman ver.1 users - just update your bot from trunk OR copy your dynamic into trunk version. there is nothing more to do, afaik ^_^
